        <h3>Macbook air : </h3>
        <p>


          The MacBook Air is a line of laptop computers developed and manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and, in the more modern versions, a thin light structure. The Air was originally
          positioned above the previous MacBook line as a premium ultraportable.[2] Since then, the original MacBook's discontinuation in 2011, and lowered prices on subsequent iterations, have made the Air Apple's entry-level laptop.</p>

        <p>
          The first generation MacBook Pro used the design of the PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model was introduced in January
          2006; the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo processors and LED-backlit displays.
